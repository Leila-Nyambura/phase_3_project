    "SyriaTel is one of the major telecommunications company in Syria, known for providing mobile and internet services across the country. It was founded in 2000 and is one of the two main mobile network operators in Syria, the other being MTN Syria. SyriaTel provides voice, data, and messaging services, including prepaid and postpaid mobile plans. It also offers mobile broadband services and various value-added services like ring-back tones, mobile TV, and mobile payment solutions. The company has faced numerous challenges due to the Syrian civil war, including infrastructure damage, economic sanctions, and political instability. These factors have impacted its operations and financial performance over the years.\n",

    "Customer churn is where customers stop using a company's product or service over a given period of time. It is a critical metric for businesses as it directly impacts profitability and growth. The project's goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will (\"soon\") stop doing business with SyriaTel. By analyzing customer data, the model will enable SyriaTel to pinpoint customers most likely to discontinue their service, enabling targeted retention strategies."
